        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm Julian, a graduate student at Northeastern University studying Data Science, as part of the PlusOne program. I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in product management, model development, and finance, starting in Summer 2025.</p>
        <p>My academic interests include deep learning, natural language processing, and network science. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring the outdoors, playing guitar, and learning about urban deisgn, philosophy, and neuroscience.</p>
        <p>This fall, I was accepted into Kaggle's KaggleX fellowship program, which represents a mentorship and networking opportunity for young BIPOC AI/ML professionals. During the fellowship, I will be developing an LLM-based application using Gemma for fine tuning under the mentorship of a ML professional.</p>
        <p>My previous professional experience lies in the investment management sector, where I've assisted both multi-asset and fixed income portfolio managers with datadashboards, data pipline scripts, and technical support. In addition, during my time with Parametric, under Morgan Stanley, I developed an email extension prototype that used LLM's to programatically inject professionalism into client service emails, allowing for more efficient scalability as Parametric's fixed income business grows.</p>
